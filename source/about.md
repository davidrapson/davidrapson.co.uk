# About

Hey, I'm David. I'm a UX-driven software developer; which is just a snappy way of saying I make websites.

I currently work as a Software Developer with the [Big Lottery Fund](github.com/biglotteryfund/). Previously at [Made Media](https://made.meda/) and [The Guardian](http://developers.theguardian.com/).
