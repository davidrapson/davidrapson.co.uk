# About

Hey, I'm David. I'm a UX-driven client-side developer; which is is just a snappy way of saying I make websites.

I currently work at [The Guardian](http://developers.theguardian.com/) as a client-side developer and previously worked at [Made Media](http://mademedia.co.uk/) as UX Architect.
