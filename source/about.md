# About

Hey, I'm David. I'm a UX-driven client-side developer; which is just a snappy way of saying I make websites.

I currently work at [Made Media](http://mademedia.co.uk/) and previously at [The Guardian](http://developers.theguardian.com/).

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Type set in FontFont's [FF Meta Web Pro Condensed](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-web-pro-condensed) for display text and [FF Meta Web Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-web-pro) for body copy.
