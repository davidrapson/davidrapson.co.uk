The last time I wrote a post was December 2014, yet since then I've [worked on the site quite a bit](https://github.com/davidrapson/davidrapson.co.uk/commits/master). I've gone HTTPS only and learned how to [configure a solid TLS setup](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=davidrapson.co.uk); I've set up a Content Security Policy and [generally improved the security of my site](https://httpsecurityreport.com/?report=davidrapson.co.uk); I've moved to a [CI step](https://circleci.com/gh/davidrapson/davidrapson.co.uk/) for my builds and deployment; I'm serving hashed assets via a CDN and I [monitor their size over time](https://twitter.com/davidrapson/status/550769765447655424); and have generally [dorked around](https://github.com/davidrapson/davidrapson.co.uk/commit/013f70ffdf640a69e02dbe87c0534dddc85dab03) with the whole thing. Oh and the site is [stupid fast](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/150726_C9_HKQ/). **But the thing is, I didn't need to do any of this** *(but I'm totally glad I did)*.

More than being an excuse to write—which clearly hasn't worked—building my own website has been an excuse to experiment; the process is as much if not more important than the result. Here's to more tinkering.
